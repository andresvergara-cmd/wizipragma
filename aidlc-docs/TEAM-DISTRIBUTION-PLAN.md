# Team Distribution Plan - CENTLI Hackathon

## Overview

**Team Size**: 3 developers  
**Timeline**: 8 hours (hackathon)  
**Framework**: AIDLC (AI-Driven Lifecycle)  
**Current Status**: Unit 1 & 2 complete, Unit 3 in Functional Design, Unit 4 pending

---

## AIDLC Workflow Reminder

Each unit follows this sequence:
1. ✅ Functional Design (business logic, entities, rules)
2. ✅ NFR Requirements (performance, security, tech stack)
3. ✅ NFR Design (patterns, components)
4. ✅ Infrastructure Design (AWS resources, deployment)
5. ✅ Code Generation (implementation)
6. ✅ Testing & Integration

**Key Principle**: Complete each stage before moving to the next. Each stage produces artifacts that guide the next stage.

## Communication & Coordination

### Daily Standup (Every 2 hours)
- What did you complete?
- What are you working on?
- Any blockers?

### Integration Checkpoints
- **Hour 2**: Verify NFR artifacts are aligned
- **Hour 4**: First integration test (Unit 2 + Unit 3)
- **Hour 6**: Full integration test (all units)

### Shared Resources
- **Git Repository**: `feature/hackaton` branch
- **Documentation**: `aidlc-docs/` directory
- **Deployment**: Shared AWS account (profile: 777937796305_Ps-HackatonAgentic-Mexico)

### Conflict Resolution
- **Code conflicts**: Dev 3 mediates
- **Design conflicts**: Refer to AIDLC artifacts
- **Integration issues**: All devs collaborate

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Dev gets blocked on AIDLC stage
**Mitigation**: 
- Dev 3 can help unblock
- Can skip optional stages (e.g., NFR Design if time is tight)
- Focus on Must Have stories only

### Risk 2: Integration issues between units
**Mitigation**:
- Dev 3 dedicated to integration testing
- Integration contracts already defined in unit-of-work.md
- EventBridge provides loose coupling

### Risk 3: Time runs out
**Mitigation**:
- Prioritize Must Have stories (15 stories)
- Defer Should/Could Have stories (4 stories)
- Simplify implementation (use mocks, skip edge cases)

---

### Unit 3 (Dev 2):
- ✅ All 9 Lambda functions deployed
- ✅ All 6 DynamoDB tables created

## AIDLC Best Practices for Team

### 1. Trust the Process
- Each stage builds on the previous one
- Don't skip stages (they save time later)
- Artifacts guide implementation

### 2. Review Before Approving
- Read generated artifacts carefully
- Ask questions if unclear
- Suggest changes if needed

### 3. Communicate Changes
- If you change a design decision, update artifacts
- Notify other devs of changes
- Keep aidlc-state.md updated

### 4. Use Agents Effectively
- Agents have context from artifacts
- Ask agents for help with implementation
- Agents can generate boilerplate code

### 5. Test Early and Often
- Don't wait until the end to test
- Test each Lambda function individually
- Test integration points as soon as possible
